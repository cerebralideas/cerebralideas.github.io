Presentation at EnterpriseJS in Austin Texas explaining how we built the PayPal Wallet Platform, a universal (isomorphic) application.

## Summary

Achieving next to perfect universality (aka isomorphism) in real-world, complex web-applications is hard, but worth the investment. This talk will focus on what we learned building our first, fully universal application at PayPal, and the technology we chose to unlock this potential. There will be code examples and advanced topics including: universal application design, unidirectional execution, functional programming, asynchronous and synchronous code, so don't forget your thinking caps!
